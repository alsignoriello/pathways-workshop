Thanks for coming to our workshop! You're here today because you want to learn
to code.

We only have two hours with you, so we won't be able to show you how to
build the next Facebook, but we will be able to show you that coding is
not as hard as you might think. By the end of the workshop, you should
having a working website that you can show to your friends and family.

Our goal is to give you the confidence that if you want to learn to code,
you can do it. It's not hard.

We started Code New Haven, which is an organization dedicated to teaching
high schoolers from New Haven how to code. This semester we have been
teaching a class at Metro Business Academy (MBA) how to code websites.

**PLEASE ASK US ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE! We're here to help you!!!**

## MBA Student Websites

Here are some of the websites the MBA kids have made!

- <http://laavila.github.io/>
- <http://creeperfan5236.github.io/>
- <http://spectryn.github.io/mywebsite%20copy%202.HTML>
- <http://mynamesmari.github.io/ImarisWebsite.html>
- <http://deondre.github.io/cubes.html>

They're a work in progress, but a great start! By the end of today, you're

# Tutorial

Don't worry if this all looks confusing. We're going to go over it with you
for the first 30 minutes, and then we're here to help.


The goal today is to build a website for yourself. Here's an example
of what you're going to build:

## High level

At a high level, this is what you're going to do in the next hour:

1. Create an account on **GitHub** (that's this website)

2. Create a **GitHub repository** for yourself.

3. **Clone** the repository, so you have a **directory** on your computer.

4. Create some **HTML files** in the repository.

5. Open the HTML files in your browser -- that's your website!!

6. **Push the code to github** so anyone can see it! :)

If any of this looks confusing to you now, don't worry, it won't be soon!
It's actually all very simple.
