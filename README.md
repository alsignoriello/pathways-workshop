Thanks for coming to our workshop! You're here today because you want to learn
to code.

We only have two hours with you, so we won't be able to show you how to
build the next Facebook, but we will be able to show you that coding is
not as hard as you might think. By the end of the workshop, you should

Our goal is to give you the confidence that if you want to learn to code,
you can do it. It's not hard.
